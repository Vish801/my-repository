                        <p>
                            Vegetable Pakora is a popular savory fritter served as snack or appetizer especially in North India. Made of chickpea batter gives the pakoras a unique flavor and their crispy crust encases the different types of vegetables within it.

 

Recent days they have also started adding chunks of meat for example chicken fritters or fish fritters etc. Pakoras are often street food and sold at various food stalls or chaat bhandars wrapping them in a newspaper cone. They are truly hot, yummy and drizzled with chat masala over to give that zest of taste to the vegetable pakora.

 

Vegetable pakora has its own unique taste other than the onion pakora or potato fritters and is served with a chilli sauce, mint yoghurt sauce or sweet and sour sauce. It can also be eaten on its own. Vegetable Pakora along with the regular mirchi bajji or plantain bajji are all time favorite snacks throughout India and is ideal and perfect for a rainy day or cocktail party.

 

They taste exceptional when paired with a cup of hot spicy masala or ordinary Indian Chai (Tea). Vegetable Pakoras are made with different types of vegetables which are nicely combined in a spicy batter (gram flour) and deep-fried until golden brown. Vegetable Pakora is a popular snack prepared during the festival of Holi (colors festival) which is known for its traditional cuisines.

 

Several scrumptious recipes are prepared in every Indian home on the occasion of Holi. Apart from full course meal, varieties of snacks are prepared on this occasion. Some of the popular snacks include Namak Pare, Dahi Bhalle, Papadi and Vegetable Pakoda.

 

Made of several vegetables like potato, cabbage, spinach wrapped in chickpea flour or besan, Vegetable Pakoda is an extremely scrumptious light snack that can be served with any sweet dish. It is very easy to prepare and hardly takes half an hour to be ready to be served.

 

Pakora also commonly known as Pakoda or Bhajji is a fried snack (fritter) popular across South Asia. Pakoras are created by taking one or two ingredients such as onion, eggplant, potato, spinach, plantain, cauliflower, tomato, chilli, or occasionally bread or chicken and dipping them in a batter of gram flour and then deep-frying them.

                        <h3 class="text-center">Vegetable Pulao</h3>
                        <p>
                             Vegetable Pulao is my all time family favorite!  It is one of the best savior dishes in many kitchens during many occasions like dropping of sudden guests at home or feeling like eating something different from the normal routine meal etc.
It’s a complete balanced dish that can be eaten by its own or accompanied with cucumber or mixed raita. Originally Vegetable pulao is a north Indian vegetarian dish that can be easily prepared in the rice cookers within minutes. This dish can also be served with any chicken, mutton or veg side dish or simply enjoyed with raita, pickle and papad.
Vegetable Pulao is a versatile dish that can give way to a lot of room for your own innovation. There is no set rule or method in preparing this dish. You can use either one or any number of vegetables, make it spicy or mild easily molding it to suit your mood for the day.
There are many who are novice about the difference between the pulao and the biryani. Pulao is a dish that is combined with all the ingredients like vegetables, meat, spices cooked together to make the dish but in case of biryani they are half cooked separately and put in layers and cooked on dum (slow process of cooking over a very slow flame).
The pulaos are the main contender in the comfort food and extremely high on demand in many restaurants. Along with the pulao follow a variety of spiced rice like the tomato rice, lemon rice, mango rice etc. Pulao is a very popular main course dish that trance all with its aromatic vibes it creates while preparing the dish with profound fascination and also has made its way in the façade of Indian cuisine.
An absolutely alluring dish that makes you strongly craves to devour only the comforting foods in the days to follow. The roots of the recipe of the vegetable pulao is strongly attached to the north Indian cuisine and slowly moved across the threshold of south Indian cuisine leaving them too absolutely mesmerized with its heavenly aromatic fragrance that fills the whole areas with its subtle flavors.
I would sincerely suggest and advice that it is always best to make a healthy and nutritious vegetable pulao at home which is not either too over cooked or lightly cooked, too oily or too insipid and shall keep your culinary skills high.
For preparing this dish, firstly in a pan add some ghee in a pan and the whole garam masala (cardamom, cloves, cinnamon, shahi jeera, bay leaves, javitri) black peppercorns, black cumin, chopped onions and sauté till they are slightly colored, add salt and ginger garlic paste and sauté.
Add choppe green chillies, mint leaves, chopped cilantro, add a little chilli powder, cumin powder and coriander powder (optional). Add the cut potatoes, sauté the potatoes and add the remaining vegetable like carrots, green peas.
Add small amount of yoghurt (optional) and sauté. Wash and soak the basmati rice for about 20 mins in the rice cooker and than add the above masala to the rice and mix well. Switch on the rice cooker and then allow cooking until the rice is soft.
When it’s almost done lastly add little saffron color and wait till the rice cooker automatically switches off. The vegetable pulao is ready. To give that extra zing and crispiness to the pulao you can garnish it with roasted cashewnuts. This dish is truly a wonder dish with the natural earthy flavors of the herbs and spices that makes the dish very delicious and sumptuous.
